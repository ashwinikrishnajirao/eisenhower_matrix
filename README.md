**Eisenhower Priority Matrix Web App**
*Revolutionize your task stratergy with this Priority Matrix app*


The Eisenhower Priority Matrix Web Application represents a transformative approach to task management, offering a user-friendly platform rooted in the principles of the renowned Eisenhower Priority Matrix.

This project introduces a web-based application that empowers users to categorize and prioritize their tasks based on their importance and urgency, fundamentally reshaping how they manage their time and productivity.

The application's core features include a quadrant-based organization system, allowing users to classify tasks into four distinct categories: "Important and Urgent," "Important and Not Urgent," "Not Important and Urgent," and "Not Important and Not Urgent." Furthermore, users can assign priority levels to tasks, enabling them to differentiate between critical and less pressing activities. As tasks are completed, they are visually marked to provide a sense of accomplishment and progress.

The application also offers theme customization, with both light and dark themes, enhancing the user experience. Notably, the project incorporates data persistence, ensuring that entered tasks remain intact even after page refreshes.

Through a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application boasts an intuitive and visually appealing interface, empowering users to regain control over their tasks, optimize their time management strategies, and ultimately achieve their goals with greater efficiency.

Additionally, this project includes a sign-up and login feature, allowing users to create an account and securely log in to access their tasks. User data is stored safely on the website, and users can access their tasks even after refreshing the page. The application offers two modes, dark and light, to cater to different users' preferences.
